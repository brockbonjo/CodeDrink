# Code Drink
hi :)
### Concept
Being bootcamp students (both Software Engineering and UX/UI), we find ourselves unwinding after a long day of coding and designing by grabbing a beer with our fellow students. While brainstorming ideas for this project, we thought about how much we love playing games and asked ourselves, "Why not build something we're passionate about, while also having fun?" Lo and behold, Code Drink! A way to learn some basic python functions and have fun with your peers.

### How to Use
Opening screen will prompt users to create a profile and login by answering a few questions. The answers to these questions will be used during the game in each of the 'functions'. 
We will use each of the users answered profile questions in functions to determine who will drink each round. It is then up to the users/players to figure out the algorithm and who will be drinking that round.
